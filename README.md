Titanic Survival Prediction

This project focuses on predicting whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using classical machine learning models. The goal was to explore different classification techniques and evaluate their performance. 

## Dataset
- Source: `train.csv` (from Kaggle)

## Preprocessing
- Handled missing values.
- Dropped irrelevant columns.
- Engineered a new feature.
- Encoded categorical variables.

## Models Used

- Logistic Regression  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Decision Tree  
- Naive Bayes

Each model was trained and evaluated using accuracy and classification metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results

All models were compared. Logistic Regression performed the best overall, achieving around 80% accuracy.
